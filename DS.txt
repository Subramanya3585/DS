What is Data science?
Data Science is a blend of machine learning algorithms, statistics, business intelligence, programming. It is helpful in discovering hidden patterns from the raw data which in turn helps to increase revenue and customer satisfaction.

Below are DS Steps
level1 is fine.

Level2
Step5 needs to contain has to been replaced with below one.
	- Treating missing values and infinite in Numpy.
	- compute mean, min, max on the ndarray.
	- difference between flatten() and ravel().
	- finding unique items and the counts.


- Treating missing values and infinite in Numpy.
Missing values can be represented using np.nan object, while np.inf represents infinite. Letâ€™s place some in arr2d.	

# we have created a numpy array and create a missing value and infinite case.
list2 = [[1, 2, 3, 4],[3, 4, 5, 6], [5, 6, 7, 8]]
arr2 = np.array(list2, dtype='float')

# Insert a nan and an inf
arr2[1,2] = np.nan  # not a number
arr2[2,3] = np.inf  # infinite
arr2


#now we are replacing nan and inf with 0. Don't use arr2== np.nan
missing_bool = np.isnan(arr2) | np.isinf(arr2)
arr2[missing_bool] = 0  
arr2


- compute mean, min, max on the ndarray.
The ndarray has the respective methods to compute this for the whole array.

# mean, max and min
print("Mean value is: ", arr2.mean())
print("Max value is: ", arr2.max())
print("Min value is: ", arr2.min())

However, if you want to compute the minimum/maxmimum values row wise or column wise, use the np.amin and np.amax version resepectively.
# Row wise and column wise min
print("Column wise minimum: ", np.amin(arr2, axis=0))
print("Row wise minimum: ", np.amin(arr2, axis=1))

# Row wise and column wise max
print("Column wise minimum: ", np.amax(arr2, axis=0))
print("Row wise minimum: ", np.amax(arr2, axis=1))


Computing the minimum row-wise is fine. But what if you want to do some other computation/function row-wise? It can be done using the np.apply_over_axis which you will see in the upcoming topic.
# Cumulative Sum
np.cumsum(arr2)


- difference between flatten() and ravel().
There are 2 popular ways to implement flattening. That is using the flatten() method and the other using the ravel() method.

The difference between ravel and flatten is, the new array created using ravel is actually a reference to the parent array. So, any changes to the new array will affect the parent as well. But is memory efficient since it does not create a copy.

# Flatten it to a 1d array
arr2.flatten()

# Changing the flattened array does not change parent
b1 = arr2.flatten()  
b1[0] = 100  # changing b1 does not affect arr2
arr2

# Changing the raveled array changes the parent also.
b2 = arr2.ravel()  
b2[0] = 101  # changing b2 changes arr2 also
arr2


- finding unique items and the counts.
The np.unique method can be used to get the unique items. If you want the repetition counts of each item, set the return_counts parameter to True.

# Create random integers of size 10 between [0,10)
np.random.seed(100)#get a same random number we need to set a seed.
arr_rand = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=10)
print(arr_rand)


# Get the unique items and their counts
uniqs, counts = np.unique(arr_rand, return_counts=True)
print("Unique items : ", uniqs)
print("Counts : ", counts)

Numpy Assignment	
-Load the data file
-Extract the column1, column3 and column6 arrays to arrays T, S, P and mask out invalid data (the nan values from missing points).
-Extract the date, column2, column5, and level arrays.
-Note the shapes of T, S and P compared to these arrays. How do they line up?

Level2 pandas - all the step are fine in this level

Pandas Assignment
- Read the csv files data using pandas library
- check the data types of the column and see whether date column is the date format if not correct it.
- find the summary statistics of data 
- Find the 10 states / countries with the highest number of earthquakes?
- Find the top 10 states / countries where the strongest and weakest earthquakes occured
